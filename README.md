## Motivation

With VSCode being so flexible and so many things have started integrating with it (You Name It , Need a Live Server , available in VSCode as Extension , Need a Debugger , Available in VScode as Extension , Need a Postman alternative , Available in VScode as Extention) there is no way I have to leave my workspace to monitor my System using task manager , well no More INTRODUCING Snap-Status as new way to bring command task manager functionality to VSCode workspace.
